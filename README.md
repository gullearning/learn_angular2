# Learn Angular2
A simple project to store the steps I used to learn angular2 from angular.io and other resources.

## Steps to build for dev
* Clone the project repo    `git clone <gihub-clone-url>`
* Run `npm install` to install the dev and runtime dependencies
* Run the following commands in two command terminals in parallel:

  `npm run tsc:w`
 
  `npm run lite`

* _Note: The js files are not committed to git and will be generated by virtue of executing_ ` npm run tsc:w`
